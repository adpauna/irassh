# Welcome to the irassh GitHub repository

This is the official repository for the irassh SSH and Telnet Honeypot effort.

## Requirements

Software required:

* Python 2.7+, (Python 3 not yet supported due to Twisted dependencies)
* python-virtualenv

For Python dependencies, see requirements.txt

## Files of interest:

* `irassh.cfg` - Cowrie's configuration file. Default values can be found in `cowrie.cfg.dist`
* `data/fs.pickle` - fake filesystem
* `data/userdb.txt` - credentials allowed or disallowed to access the honeypot
* `dl/` - files transferred from the attacker to the honeypot are stored here
* `honeyfs/` - file contents for the fake filesystem - feel free to copy a real system here or use `bin/fsctl`
* `log/irassh.json` - transaction output in JSON format
* `log/irassh.log` - log/debug output
* `log/tty/*.log` - session logs
* `txtcmds/` - file contents for the fake commands
* `bin/createfs` - used to create the fake filesystem
* `bin/playlog` - utility to replay session logs
